1. generate 10^4 random dir for a fixed regular order-2 tet. ===> regular_batch_fixed_val_rand_dir.txt
2. compute exact collision time for each data.  ===> collision_time.txt
3. compute collision time using my method with subdivision_depth=1, test how long would hocgv take to achieve the same accuracy.
